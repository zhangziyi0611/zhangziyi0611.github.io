## About Me

I am a third-year undergraduate student at the [School of Medicine](https://med.nankai.edu.cn/), [Nankai University](https://www.nankai.edu.cn/), majoring in Intelligent Medical Engineering. My research interests include deep learning, medical image analysis, and large language models.

In the summer of 2024, I participated in the **"Ligong Program"**, interning at the Computer Center of Zigong Third People's Hospital, Sichuan Province. During this internship, I focused on **model deployment** and **cell image segmentation**.  

At university, I actively engage in research and academic projects. I serve as the **team leader** of a National College Student Innovation Project in the **School of Artificial Intelligence**, where we explore applications of **large language models**. Additionally, I have studied and conducted research on **multiple myeloma detection** and **bone segmentation** as part of deep learning coursework.
